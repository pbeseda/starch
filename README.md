an architecture genealogy database  
an open project by Patrick Beseda  

starch is a suite of tools for exploring the relationships between individuals and organizations working in and studying architecture. The result will be a research tool, useful for understanding and positioning not only an individual (including oneself) but entire schools of design thought, transfers of knowledge, movements in architectural pedagogy and societal and cultural trends in architectural thinking.
